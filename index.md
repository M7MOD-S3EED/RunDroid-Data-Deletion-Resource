# Data Deletion Resource for RunDroid
This page is designed to help you, our valued RunDroid users, understand and exercise your rights over the data collected by our game. We believe in transparency and giving you control over your data. Here, you’ll find detailed instructions on how to delete or manage the data we collect.

# Data controlled by Alien Eye:
## 1-Analytics Data (Data collected Using Unity UGS Analytics):
Analytics data is information collected about your use of the RunDroid game, such as gameplay duration, levels completed, and in-game purchases. This data is collected using Unity’s Universal GameDev Services (UGS) Analytics.
When you install the game, Unity Analytics generates a random user ID for analytics data collection.
This ID is separate from your player account, so deleting your player account does not delete the analytics data collected.

### To delete analytics data:
 1-Open RunDroid
 2-Navigate to Options > Account & Privacy > Data & Privacy
 3-Select **Delete Analytics Collected Data**

Deleting analytics data will automatically change your Analytics Data Collection Consent, stopping any further data collection.
You can change the Analytics Data Collection Consent at any time by navigating to **Options > Account & Privacy > Data & Privacy > Press Change Analytics Data Collection Consent**.


### 2-Player account & associated Data:
To delete your RunDroid player account and all associated data:
 1-Open RunDroid
 2-Navigate to Options > Account & Privacy > Player Account
 3-Select **Delete Player Account**
  
**This will delete the logged-in player account, all its associated data, and player progress from our records. Please note that this action is permanent and irreversible.**
**We encourage you to delete your RunDroid player account using the in-game method as it’s simpler and takes effect immediately.**

Alternatively, you can send us a RunDroid Player Account Deletion request using this [form](). Your submitted request will be addressed by us as early as possible, within 30 days.

# Data not Managed by Alien Eye:
## 1-Google Play Games Services:
Users can delete their account and all associated games data collected by Google through their [Play Games profile](https://play.google.com/games/profile) or [Google MyAccount](https://myaccount.google.com/)
If Google collects Play Games Services data for an individual game, users can delete the data through their [Play Games profile](https://play.google.com/games/profile)

## 2-Google AdMob (Mobile Ads SDK):
The Advertising ID can be reset or deleted by users using ad ID controls in the Android settings menu.
